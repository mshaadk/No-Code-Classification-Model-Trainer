# No-Code Classification Model Trainer

This project enables users to train and evaluate classification machine learning models without writing a single line of code. Built with Streamlit, the application provides an interactive interface to load datasets, preprocess data, select machine learning models, and evaluate the modelâ€™s performance. It supports multiple models including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classifier, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

## Features
- **Dataset Handling**: Load CSV and Excel files for training.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Automatically handles missing values, numerical scaling, and categorical encoding.
- **Model Selection**: Choose from Logistic Regression, SVC, Random Forest, or XGBoost for model training.
- **Model Training**: Train your selected model with the preprocessed data.
- **Model Evaluation**: Provides test accuracy results for trained models.
- **Model Saving**: Trained models are saved in a pkl format for later use.

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/mshaadk/No-Code-Classification-Model-Trainer.git
  ```

2. **Install the required dependencies**:

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

3. **Run the application**:

  ```bash
  streamlit run main.py
  ```

## Usage
- **Select Dataset**: Upload your dataset in CSV or Excel format.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Choose a target column and a scaling technique.
- **Model Selection**: Select a machine learning model for training.
- **Model Training**: Click on "Train the Model" to initiate training.
- **Model Evaluation**: View the test accuracy and model performance.
- **Model Saving**: The trained model will be saved for later use in the trained_model/ folder.
